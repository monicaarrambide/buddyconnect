# README

This README documents all steps necessary to get the application up and running.

# Introduction

This is a web application we're developing that focuses on connecting incoming MS students to each other in order to establish
a more comfortable and friendly environment. This web application will automate a matching process between new and current students
based on their responses for questions such as work experience, career interest, extracurricular activities, place of residence, etc.,
in order to assign and set groups of other like-minded individuals.

* PostgresSQL - 12.3.0 
* Ruby Gems - Listed in `Gemfile`
* Nodejs - v16.9.1
* Yarn - 1.22.11

# External Deps

An RSpec test suite is available and can be ran using:

`rspec spec/.` OR `rspec spec/. --format documentationton` get a more in-depth reading and understanding

# Execute Code

Run the following code in Powershell if using windows or the terminal using Linux/Mac

`cd your_github_here`

Run **one** of the following commands for your respective device:

**For Windows or non-M1 chip Linux/Mac:**

`docker run --rm -it --volume "$(pwd):/rails_app" -e DATABASE_USER=test_app -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=test_password -p 3000:3000 dmartinez05/ruby_rails_postgresql:latest`

`rails server --binding:0.0.0.0`

The application can be seen using a browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000/

# Environmental Variables/Files

There are currently two environment variables that need to be confifured to run this application. If you are 
running it locally then they can be set in config/environments/development.rb * Otherwise, they will need to be set
as both GitHub secrets as well as Heroku deployment config variables.
* GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
* GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET

An in-depth guide on how to set these variables on Heroku can be accessed [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars "here"). A guide to get the Google OAuth IDs can be found [here](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-do-i-get-an-oauth-credential-35d6d0e5d617).

# CI/CD

For Continuous Integration, a workflow (workflow.yml) file was created to run Rspec, Rubocop, and Brakeman upon every push and pull requests.

The file can be found here `/.github/workflows/workflow.yml` within this repository.

Please refer to this link if you want to read more on how we set-up our continuous integration:

For Continuous Deployment, auto-deployment on master and test branch was used after Continuous Integration has passed on Heroku
